# Burger

## Description 

 * A restaurant app that lets user input the names of burgers they'd like to eat 

## Installation Instructions

 * Clone repo to your pc

 * Navigate to burger folder in Terminal or Command prompt

 * Run "npm i"
 
 * Install dependencies

 * Copy and run Schema.sql and Seeds.sql files into database management system UI of your choice (MYSQL)

 * Navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser

                or
                                        
 * Click on the Heroku Deployed Link below
 
 * Enjoy the burger time app

## How It Works

 * When on the Burger page there will be an empty form to "Add a new burger" 
 
 * After hitting submit the burger that the user typed in will be sent under "Burgers to devour!"
 
 * Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page under "Burgers to        devour"  That is where the burgers are waiting to be devoured

 * Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right          side of the page under "Devoured burgers"

 * The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

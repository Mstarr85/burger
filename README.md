* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
